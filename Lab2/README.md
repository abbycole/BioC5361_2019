# R Basics

R is a language you will want to get familiar with to improve your ability to understand, analyse, and visualize your data. 

To begin to get comfortable with R, a good resouce is a package called swirl.

Open RStudio and enter these commands in the console to get started.

## Install and load swirl
```
install.packages("swirl")
```
With swirl installed in your package library, it's time to load it so we can use it.

```
library(swirl)
```
Notice that the convention in R is to use "" around the package name with install.packages, but to omit the "" when loading a package.

Follow the prompts in the console and select "1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R"

## Complete swirl practice 1. Basic Building Blocks
To start with I reccomend you work through the first module titled "Basic Building Blocks". 


If you have R on your own computer, then I recommend completing the other courses, particularly 2-4 intially as they will give you a nice introduction to R and should help you to feel more confident using R for basic analysis:

1. Basic Building Blocks      
2. Workspace and Files    
3. Sequences of Numbers
4. Vectors
