# Lab 10: R Pipelines for microbiome sequencing data

Today we will walk through a tutorial by Benjamin Callahan for how to use DADA2 on amplicon data. This tutorial ends by briefly using phyloseq for basic diversity analyses.

You can download the R script included in this directory to walk through the tutorial commands on your own computer.
